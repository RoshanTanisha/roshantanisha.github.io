            Samyañc – My Spiritual Guru.
        </title>
        <description>
            Samyañc - My Spiritual Guru: `thelogicalkoan` is a closed domain question answering system for the spirituality domain, answering the question on the basis of the word-to-word English translated version of Shrimad Bhagavad Gita. The system uses Natural Language Processing and Understanding techniques with multiple data representations for fetching the answer. Several algorithms are designed to implement the system. Studied various research papers on NLP and QA Systems, thus selected and implemented the best fit for the system. The system is properly tested with different kinds of test cases to which it responds correctly.

        <title>Implementing Data poisoining attacks in federated learning environment and how to combat them
        <description>
            Implemented a series of paper in the domain of federated learning environment for the non-iid data where data poisoining attacks are done and implemented several ways from different research paper on how to spot the client on which the attack is made and how to update the global model weights which does not contain these wrongly tempered weights. Visualized the results. Implemented DDPG algorithm that would select the client properly.

            COVID19 X-RAY Images Classification
        </title>
        <description>
            Created a UNet based classifier that would classify whether the X-RAY images are infected
            by COVID19 or not. With 136 COVID19 images and 100 normal images, trained on 188 train images and
            validated on 48 images, achieved validation accuracy of ~85%.

        <description>
            Created a web app, for getting predictions whether a loan applicant will default or not using their
            current loan details, and their previous loan details. The model testing is done using AUROC score.
